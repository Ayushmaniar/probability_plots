# Probability plots
This repository has python code for plotting standard random variable distributions.

**The only requirements are numpy and matplotlib**

1) Binomial_random_variable:
    * Takes in p (probability of getting heads as an argument)
2) Exponential_random_variable:
    * Takes in lmda and n as arguments
3) Geometric_random_variable:
    * Takes in p of getting heads and n as the first time we get heads as the arguments
4) Poisson_random_variable:
    * Takes in p and n as arguments
